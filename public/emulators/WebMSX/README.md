## About the NetPlay! feature

WebMSX 5.0 brings NetPlay!, in which any number of users may connect and control the same virtual MSX machine.
To access the feature, open the NetPlay! control dialog available on the System Menu (Power button).

One user must be the "Server" and start a NetPlay! Session. Just choose a name for the Session, or let the emulator generate it randomly, then hit "START".
Once the Session is started and active, other users may join the Session simply by entering the same Session name and hitting "JOIN".
All users connected have complete control over the machine, except that only the Server user may load/change media files (ROMs, Disks, etc). All features of the emulator work during NetPlay!
Any Client user may leave the Session at any time, but only the Server user may end the Session completely.

Be careful not to make your Session name public! Anyone that knows your Session name will be able to join it while its active. Send the session name only to people you want to invite.
Another way of sharing your Session to users is sending them a link that will open the emulator and join the session automatically.
In the NetPlay! dialog, once you are Hosting a Session, there will be a link button on the upper right, that will generate the link and copy it to your clipboard.

**IMPORTANT:** NetPlay! performance is completely dependent on the network quality. The lower the network latency between users, the better. Higher bandwidths with higher latencies won't help much.
It uses a specialized P2P protocol, and tries to use STUN to traverse NATs/routers so users don't have to worry about IPs and opening ports. Use at your own risk! :-)

To make all this work seamlessly, WebMSX uses modern Web technologies including WebRTC, which are supported by all major browsers and platforms.
Unfortunately, those technologies are still not available on Apple iOS, so NetPlay! will not work on iOS devices. Sorry but there is not much we can do about it, until Apple feels it should allow its customers to access those technologies.

## About the Nextor Hard Disk Drive

To make the Hard Disk Drive available, you must first activate the Hard Drive Extension, through the Extensions Menu on the user interface, or by using the respective Presets.
The Hard Disk device may be placed "before" the Floppy Drives, so it will appear on the system as Drive A, or "after" the Floppy Drives, so it will appear as Drive C. The position depends on which Slot the Extension is activated on.
If using Presets, there are two available: `HARDDISK` will place the device as Drive A, and `HARDDISKC` will place it as Drive C.
On the Hard Drive menu (HD icon), there are options to automatically create Empty and Boot disks of several sizes. You can also load DSK images, Files or ZIPs normally.

## WebMSX Configuration and Launch Options

Several parameters are available for customizing the emulator. They can be changed either directly in Javascript if you are hosting the emulator in your own page, or via URL Query Parameters if you are creating links or bookmarks to open the emulator, or just using it in your browser.

All parameters are in the form of properties in the global object `WMSX`. Just set these object properties in Javascript, or use URL Query parameter/value pairs. For example:

```
WMSX.ROM = "files/Game.rom";      is the same as      http://webmsx.org?ROM=files/Game.rom
```

**IMPORTANT:** Any parameter setting via Javascript must be done AFTER importing the `webmsx.js` file.

Another important concept is the use of configuration **Presets**. Some configurations are a bit complicated and may require setting various parameters in conjunction. For those cases, its easier to use a Preset that will automatically set all the relevant parameters for a specific task. You may specify any number of Presets to be used by setting the `PRESETS` parameter, with a comma separated list of the Preset names to apply. For example:

```
WMSX.PRESETS = "RAM128, NODISK";         or           http://webmsx.org?PRESETS=RAM128,NODISK
```

## Media Loading

The emulator can be set to automatically load files like ROMs, DSK and CAS images. Additionally, files can be loaded and automatically injected into any of the Disks Drives, without having to first create an image. Image files may be compressed in ZIP or GZIP formats. If several Disk images are found in a ZIP file, all of them (up to 10) will be loaded in the Drive Stack. Available parameters:

| Parameter | Function | Shortcut for URL form
| --- | --- | ---
| `CARTRIDGE1_URL`     | URL of ROM image file to load in Slot 1              | `ROM`, `CART1`

| `HARDDISK_FILES_URL` | URL of file or ZIP (for several files) to load in Hard Drive | `HARDDISK_FILES`
| `TAPE_URL`           | URL of Tape image file to load                       | `TAPE`
| `STATE_URL`          | URL of SaveState file to load                        | `STATE`, `SAVESTATE`
| `AUTODETECT_URL`     | URL of file to load with media auto-detection        | `AUTODETECT`, `AUTO`, `ANY`

### ROM Format (or Mapper Type)
The ROM Format is auto-detected. To force a format, set the `CARTRIDGE1_FORMAT` and `CARTRIDGE2_FORMAT` parameters, or access the User Interface.
You can also put the format specification in the ROM file name, between brackets. Example: `Game [KonamiSCC].rom`

#### Valid Formats
`Normal`, `Mirrored`, `NotMirrored`, `ASCII8`, `ASCII16`, `Konami`, `KonamiSCC`, `KonamiSCCI`, `ASCII8SRAM2`, `ASCII8SRAM8`, `ASCII16SRAM2`, `ASCII16SRAM8`, `GameMaster2`, `KoeiSRAM8`, `KoeiSRAM32`, `Wizardry`, `FMPAC`, `FMPAK`, `MSXDOS2`, `Majutsushi`, `Synthesizer`, `RType`, `CrossBlaim`, `Manbow2`, `HarryFox`, `AlQuran`, `AlQuranDecoded`, `Halnote`, `SuperSwangi`, `SuperLodeRunner`, `Dooly`, `Zemina80in1`, `Zemina90in1`, `Zemina126in1`, `MSXWrite`

## Enabling Extensions

The emulator supports several Extensions, or optional components that can be turned on/off. Some are in the form of expansion cartridges that can be inserted in either Slot 1 or 2. We use Presets to make configuring Extensions easier:

## Loading BASIC files and Typing commands after launch

The emulator can be set to automatically Run/Load BASIC programs after launch, or type any commands or text in the BASIC prompt. **NOTE** that these are not necessary for `AUTOEXEC.BAS` and `AUTOEXEC.BAT` files, or if you have loaded a Tape Image file (in which case the emulator will automatically detect and Run the first program in the Tape). Available parameters:

| Parameter | Action 
| --- | --- 
| `BASIC_RUN`     |  Run the specified file
| `BASIC_LOAD`    |  Load the specified file
| `BASIC_BRUN`    |  Run the specified bynary file
| `BASIC_BLOAD`   |  Load the specified bynary file
| `BASIC_TYPE`    |  Type the specified text
| `BASIC_ENTER`   |  Type the specified text then hit ENTER

## Controlling boot speed and automatically pressing keys at boot time
| Parameter | Action
| --- | ---
| `FAST_BOOT`        |  Boot at max. speed
| `BOOT_KEYS`        |  Keys to keep pressed at every boot, comma separated
| `BOOT_KEYS_ONCE`   |  Same as above, but only on first boot (do not use both)
| `BOOT_KEYS_FRAMES` |  Optional number of frames for Boot Keys

## Choosing a Machine

There are 9 different generic machines to choose from. The default machine is the MSX2+, and the emulator will try to auto-detect your region. You can ask for a specific machine by setting the `MACHINE` parameter with the respective Machine ID:

| Machine | Machine ID | Specific Machine | Machine ID 
| --- | :---: | --- | :---: 
| MSX2+ Auto-detection   | `MSX2P` | MSX2+ American (NTSC 60Hz)  |  `MSX2PA`

|                        |         | MSX1  Japanese (NTSC 60Hz)  |  `MSX1J`

## Launch URL Examples

WebMSX is great for displaying MSX software in the web. With a simple URL, you can launch the emulator and automatically load and run anything. You may combine several settings and media loading options in a single link. Here are some examples:

- To load a game in ROM format:
```
http://webmsx.org?ROM=http://gamesarchive.org/Goonies.rom
```
- To load a game in a ZIPped Disk Image and insert a SCC+ Sound Cartridge:
```
http://webmsx.org?DISK=http://gamesarchive.org/SDSnatcher.zip&PRESETS=SCCI
```
- To launch an European MSX1 machine, loading a Disk image and then run a BASIC program:
```
http://webmsx.org?MACHINE=MSX1E&DISK=http://basicmuseum.org/Demos.dsk&BASIC_RUN=Bubbles.bas
```
